The results are consistent with a previous analysis of Nc=3 lattice QCD results, and in addition permit the determination of subleading in 1/Nc effects in the spin-flavor singlet component of the baryon masses, as well as in the hyperfine splittings. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {The effective theory for baryons with combined 1/Nc and chiral expansions is analyzed for nonstrange baryons. Results for baryon masses and axial couplings are obtained in the small scale expansion, to be coined as the $\xi$ expansion, in which the 1/Nc and the low energy power countings are linked according to 1/Nc=O($\xi$)=O(p). Masses and axial couplings are analyzed to O($\xi$3) and O($\xi$2), respectively, which correspond to next-to-next to leading order evaluations, and require one-loop contributions in the effective theory. The spin-flavor approximate symmetry, a consequence of the large Nc limit in baryons, plays a very important role in the real world with Nc=3 as shown by the analysis of its breaking in the masses and the axial couplings. Applications to the recent lattice QCD results on baryon masses and the nucleon's axial coupling are presented. It is shown that those results are naturally described within the effective theory at the order considered in the $\xi$ expansion. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {We construct the complete effective chiral pion-nucleon Lagrangian to third order in small momenta based on relativistic chiral perturbation theory. We then perform the so-called heavy baryon limit and construct all terms up to and including order 1/m2 with fixed and free coefficients. As an application, we discuss in detail pion-nucleon scattering. In particular, we show that for this process and to third order, the 1/m expansion of the Born graphs calculated relativistically can be recovered exactly in the heavy baryon approach without any additional momentum-dependent wave function renormalization. We fit various empirical phase shifts for pion laboratory momenta between 50 and 100 MeV. This leads to a satisfactory description of the phase shifts up to momenta of about 200 MeV. We also predict the threshold parameters, which turn out to be in good agreement with the dispersive analysis. In particular, we can sharpen the prediction for the isovector S-wave scattering length, 0.083 M-1$\pi$ ≤ a-0+ ≤ 0.093M-1$\pi$. We also consider the subthreshold parameters and give a short comparison to other calculations of $\pi$N scattering in chiral perturbation theory or modifications thereof. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {We review the structure of Roy-Steiner equations for pion-nucleon scattering, the solution for the partial waves of the t-channel process ππ→NN, as well as the high-accuracy extraction of the pion-nucleon S-wave scattering lengths from data on pionic hydrogen and deuterium. We then proceed to construct solutions for the lowest partial waves of the s-channel process π N→ π N and demonstrate that accurate solutions can be found if the scattering lengths are imposed as constraints. Detailed error estimates of all input quantities in the solution procedure are performed and explicit parameterizations for the resulting low-energy phase shifts as well as results for subthreshold parameters and higher threshold parameters are presented. Furthermore, we discuss the extraction of the pion-nucleon σ-term via the Cheng-Dashen low-energy theorem, including the role of isospin-breaking corrections, to obtain a precision determination consistent with all constraints from analyticity, unitarity, crossing symmetry, and pionic-atom data. We perform the matching to chiral perturbation theory in the subthreshold region and detail the consequences for the chiral convergence of the threshold parameters and the nucleon mass.},
